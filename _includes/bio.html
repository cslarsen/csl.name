I'm a software developer with nearly a decade and half of work experience.
Currently I'm working on reservoir modelling software at <a
href="http://www.roxar.com">Roxar</a>.
</p>

<p>
While I've worked professionally in a dozen languages, I prefer C++, Python and
Scheme.  In fact, I'm acknowledged in the 
<a href="http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/raw-attachment/wiki/WikiStart/r7rs.pdf">Scheme R<sup>7</sup>RS specification</a>
for contributing bug reports.

I did this while writing 
<a href="https://github.com/cslarsen/mickey-scheme">my own interpreter</a>.

I also made <a href="/jp2a">jp2a</a>, which sees continued popularity.
