This is my personal collection of useful tools for Mac OS X that I regularly
seem to forget exist.

    sudo opensnoop -n <process name>

Uses dtrace to show which files a process is opening.

    otool -L <file>

The ldd tool for mac, shows shared libraries used. See also `nm`.

    diskutil ...

Can be used for a variety of purposes.

    lsof

List open files.  Can also work as a better `netstat` to show you TCP or UDP
ports that is used, e.g.

    lsof -iTCP

Very neat.

    strace

You know this, but there is also `ltrace` and `dtrace`.
