I recently had to renew the TLS certificate on [csl.name](https://csl.name),
which is hosted on [NearlyFreeSpeech (NFSN)](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net).
But I had forgotten how to. So I decided to post a [condensed version of the
steps found here][steps] on my own site.

First I made a secret key on the NearlyFreeSpeech login server (aliases as
`nfsn` here):

    ssh nfsn
    mkdir /home/protected/ssl
    cd /home/protected/ssl
    openssl genrsa -out csl.name.key 4096

Using this, I made a certificate signing request (CSR). I left most fields
blank, except FQDN, which had to be `csl.name`:

    openssl req -new -sha256 -key csl.name.key -out csl.name.csr

After buying the [Comodo PositiveSSL certificate on
NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates/comodo/positivessl.aspx),
pasting the CSR into their SSL wizard and completing the DCV verification (any
method is fine), I got a ZIP-file containing the already bundled-up [TLS
certificate chain][tls chain] along with the certificate itself.

Next I copied the files over and verified them:

    openssl verify -untrusted csl.name.chn csl.name.crt
    csl.name: OK

Note that this process failed locally, probably because I had an older version
of OpenSSL.

The final step was to file a support request with NFSN to install the
certificate, which they promptly did. Just be sure that the
`/home/protected/ssl` directory contains the _all_ the necessary files:

    csl.name.chn
    csl.name.crt
    csl.name.csr
    csl.name.key

By the way, if you're thinking about doing this you may want to consider trying
[LetsEncrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org), which give you free TLS
certificates. I don't know much about them, or how many browsers support their
CA, and so on, but it's worth a shot.
