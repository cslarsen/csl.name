Here is a video I made for the 2001 Technopolis electronic music festival
at <a href="http://www.samfundet.no">Studentersamfundet</a> in Trondheim.

It was used to present the evening's programme on several big screens
around Samfundet.  

I designed and rendered the scenes in 3D Studio Max on a laptop during a
road trip around Europe. I also used Macromedia Flash with some Action
Script to print out the text. Aftet that I added some effects with Adobe
AfterEffects and finally edited everything and rendered the final product in
Adobe Premiere.

The video below is not the final version that was shown at the festival.
The final version was a bit longer and also included some clips from the
movie [Tron][tron]

The text clips in the beginning was scanned from <a href="">Ray Gun
Magazine</a> in the days that xxx was a visual editor. The magazine had just
mindblowing design.

THe person in the video is Andy Warhol.
