This is a video I made for the 2001 _Technopolis_ electronic music festival
in the student's society in Trondheim ([Studentersamfundet][samfundet]).

Since I had worked there as a graphic designer, they asked if I could make
them a video loop that would show the evening's programme.  They would put
up several TVs around Samfundet (a really big and really awesome place for
concerts and beer) and loop this video.

I had some clips that I had made in 3D Studio Max during a road-trip in
Europe. I remember I let the Toshiba laptop render all night during a ferry
ride. Good times.

Anyway, I tried to create something that looked electronic but organic,
bathed in ultraviolet light.

I made some animated program text in Macromedia Flash, added some
miscellaneous affects in Adobe AfterEffects and edited everything in Adobe
Premiere. That was done on a desktop. I remember that the final rendering
was also an all-nighter.

The version that you can see below is not the final one that was actually
used at the festival. The final one was a bit longer and had some clips from
the original [Tron movie][tron].

The text scans in the beginning of the video was scanned from an issue of [Ray Gun
Magazine][raygun].  This was the time when the magazine had amazing
publication design by creative director and graphic genius [Chris Ashworth][ashworth].

You can also see Andy Warhol in the video, scanned from the same magazine.
