Archive.org has released a [large number of MS-DOS
games](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_msdos_games/v2) that can be
played in the browser using
[em-dosbox](https://github.com/dreamlayers/em-dosbox).  Here I'll show you how
you can compile em-dosbox and put up your own MS-DOS programs on the web.  This
guide assumes you're using Mac OS X and [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), but should be
informative for any other UNIX users as well.
{% endlead %}

Installing Emscripten
---------------------

The [em-dosbox](https://github.com/dreamlayers/em-dosbox) project
is a special fork of [DOSBox](http://www.dosbox.com) that uses
[emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) to cross-compile LLVM
bitcode to JavaScript so it can run in your browser.  Emscripten can actually
be used to cross-compile practically _any_ LLVM-compilable code to JavaScript!

So before we can build em-dosbox, we need to install emscripten. With Homebrew,
you can review installation options with:

    $ brew options emscripten

I used

    $ brew install emscripten --with-closure-compiler

Homebrew tells you that you need to update your `~/.emscripten` after running
`emcc` for the first time:

    Manually set LLVM_ROOT to
      /usr/local/opt/emscripten/libexec/llvm/bin

So let's run `emcc` first.

    $ emcc
    WARNING  root: (Emscripten: system change: 1.28.2|asmjs-unknown-emscripten||6.0 vs 1.4.7|le32-unknown-nacl, clearing cache)
    WARNING  root: LLVM version appears incorrect (seeing "6.0", expected "3.4")
    WARNING  root: could not check fastcomp: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
    INFO     root: (Emscripten: Running sanity checks)
    CRITICAL root: Cannot find clang++, check the paths in ~/.emscripten

Now edit `~/.emscripten` and comment out the line with `LLVM_ROOT`. Set it to
what Homebrew suggests:

    LLVM_ROOT = "/usr/local/opt/emscripten/libexec/llvm/bin"

Now try running `emcc` to verify that it runs without any errors.

    $ emcc
    WARNING  root: (Emscripten: settings file has changed, clearing cache)
    INFO     root: (Emscripten: Running sanity checks)
    WARNING  root: no input files


Installing em-dosbox
--------------------

You'll need the [em-dosbox source
code](https://github.com/dreamlayers/em-dosbox), and then run `autogen.sh`.  If
autogen fails, you probably need to install autotools.

    $ git clone https://github.com/dreamlayers/em-dosbox.git
    $ cd em-dosbox
    $ ./autogen.sh

That should create a `configure` file.  Now run that through `emconfigure`:

    $ emconfigure ./configure

If that works fine, you should be able to build em-dosbox:

    $ make -j4

On a successful build, you should find `dosbox.js` and `dosbox.html` in `src/`.
These are templates for the web page that you'll use to run MS-DOS programs.

To take an MS-DOS program called `TEST.EXE` and bundle it with em-dosbox,
creating the files `test.data` and `test.html`, you simply do:

    $ cd src
    $ ./packager.py test TEST.EXE

However, on my system, it complains that it can't find `file_packager.py`.
This is part of the _emscripten_ package. With Homebrew, emscripten is
symlinked to the `Cellar` directory.  You should therefore set
`EMSCRIPTEN_ROOT` in `~/.emscripten` to point to where the files are actually
located.

Check what value `EMSCRIPTEN_ROOT` is:

    $ em-config EMSCRIPTEN_ROOT

On my system I had to set this to
`/usr/local/Cellar/emscripten/1.28.2/libexec` by modifying `~/.emscripten` so
it looked like:

 Note: If you put paths relative to the home directory, do not forget os.path.expanduser

    import os

    EMSCRIPTEN_ROOT = "/usr/local/Cellar/emscripten/1.28.2/libexec"
    LLVM_ROOT = "/usr/local/opt/emscripten/libexec/llvm/bin"

    # ...

Now, I have an old intro I made with Pascal and assembly back in the day. The
file is called `A-SYSTEM.EXE`, so I ran it through the packager:

    $ cd em-dosbox/src
    $ ./packager.py a-system A-SYSTEM.EXE

This creates `a-system.data` and `a-system.html`.  But if I open the HTML file
in my browser, it won't be able to load the data file because of the
[same-origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy).
Therefore, I'll just start a simple web server in the current directory and
access it through that:

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer &
    $ open http://localhost:8000/a-system.html

This works pretty well, but the intro runs quite slow.  Hitting `CTRL-F12`
speeds up the framerate considerably. You can create a default configuration
file by putting your EXE-file into a subdirectory form `src/` and adding a
[`dosbox.conf`](http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Dosbox.conf) file in the same
directory.

I put this in `dosbox.conf`:

    [cpu]
    core = simple
    cycles = fixed 20000

    [dosbox]

    [midi]
    mpu401 = none
    mididevice = none

(I disabled MIDI to get rid of an annoying warning.)  To build the entire
directory, I ran:

    $ ./packager.py a-system a-system A-SYSTEM.EXE

where the first argument is the name of the produced `.data` and `.html` files,
the second the subfolder and the last the name of the executable DOS-file.

I haven't [tweaked the `dosbox.conf`
settings](http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Dosbox.conf), but you can [view the
A-SYSTEM 28k intro here](/a-system/).
