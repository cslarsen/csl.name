Using Lua is easy! In this short tutorial we'll show how to write a fully
working host-program in C++ with Lua callbacks.

Since the static Lua libraries are written in C, you must import them as
such:

{% highlight c++ %}
extern "C" {
#include "lua.h"
}

int main()
{
  lua_State *L = lua_open();
  lua_close(L);
  return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

_Update 2007-05-14:_ It has been reported that on some systems you need to
include the headers `lualib.h` and `lauxlib.h` to compile the above example:

{% highlight c++ %}
extern "C" {
#include "lualib.h"
#include "lauxlib.h"
}
{% endhighlight %}
